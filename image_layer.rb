# ImageLayer is probably one of the most important class of the game
# Because I decided to use CoreAnimation instead of OpenGL
# each element needs to live on a Core Animation Layer
# 
# Layers can be created with an image that's being passed
# (see initiWithImageNamed(file_name)
# or by passing a game item.
#
# Because we are dealing with a Cocoa subclass
# we need to allocate the object the same way we would do
# in Objective-C
# for instance:
# ImageLayer.alloc.initWithImageNamed('disco')
#
# We define a delegate method called drawInContext(ctx)
# that is being dispatched when the layer needs to be redrawn.

  # we need to follow the Cocoa conventions and setting up our own
  # initWith method.
